# Bruteforce a Time-seeded Random Number Generator

This repo is a practical demonstration of bruteforcing a number generated by a random number generator that is not cryptographically secure.

It has 2 components:
    - `generate_number.rb`: Generates a random number using `Ruby's Random` function and the current time as a seed
        - It stores the generated number into `./secret.txt`
    - `bruteforce.rb`: Attempts to bruteforce the secret number by trying different seeds from the past 10 seconds

This means that, as long as you run `bruteforce.rb` within 10 seconds of `generate_number.rb`, you will be able to bruteforce the number generated by `generate_number.rb`

# How to Run

- Run the "not-so-random" number generator: `ruby generate_number.rb`
- Run the bruteforcer via `ruby bruteforce.rb`
